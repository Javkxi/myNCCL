.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module packages some of the boilerplate code needed for performing code
generation typically used by perl bindings for gobject-based libraries, using
the Glib module as a base.
.PP
The default output filenames are in the subdirectory 'build', which usually
will be present if you are using ExtUtils::Depends (as most Glib-based
extensions probably should).

.PD
Many GObject-based libraries to be bound to perl will be too large to put in
a single \s-1XS\s0 file; however, a single \s-1PM\s0 file typically only bootstraps one
\&\s-1XS\s0 file's code.  \f(CW\*(C`write_boot\*(C'\fR generates an \s-1XSH\s0 file to be included from
the \s-1BOOT\s0 section of that one bootstrapped module, calling the boot code for
all the other \s-1XS\s0 files in the project.
.Sp
Options are passed to the function in a set of key/val pairs, and all options
may default.
.Sp

\&               names (as an array reference) to use instead

\&               the glob pattern.
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&  ignore       regular expression matching any and all 
\&               module names which should be ignored, i.e.
\&               NOT included in the list of symbols to boot.
\&               this parameter is extremely important for
\&               avoiding infinite loops at startup; see the
\&               discussion for an explanation and rationale.
\&               the default is '^[^:]+$', or, any name that
\&               contains no colons, i.e., any toplevel
\&               package name.
.Ve
.Sp
This function performs a glob (using perl's builtin glob operator) on the
pattern specified by the 'glob' option to retrieve a list of file names.
It then scans each file in that list for lines matching the pattern
\&\*(L"^MODULE\*(R" \*(-- that is, the \s-1MODULE\s0 directive in an \s-1XS\s0 file.  The module
name is pulled out and matched against the regular expression specified
by the ignore parameter.  If this module is not to be ignored, we next
check to see if the name has been seen.  If not, the name will be converted
to a boot symbol (basically, s/:/_/ and prepend \*(L"boot_\*(R") and this symbol
will be added to a call to \s-1GPERL_CALL_BOOT\s0 in the generated file; it is then
marked as seen so we don't call it again.
.Sp
What is this all about, you ask?  In order to bind an XSub to perl, the C
function must be registered with the interpreter.  This is the function of the
\&\*(L"boot\*(R" code, which is typically called in the bootstrapping process.  However,
when multiple \s-1XS\s0 files are used with only one \s-1PM\s0 file, some other mechanism
must call the boot code from each \s-1XS\s0 file before any of the function therein
will be available.
.Sp
A typical setup for a multiple\-XS, single-PM module will be to call the 
various bits of boot code from the \s-1BOOT:\s0 section of the toplevel module's
\&\s-1XS\s0 file.
.Sp
To use Gtk2 as an example, when you do 'use Gtk2', Gtk2.pm calls bootstrap
on Gtk2, which calls the C function boot_Gtk2.  This function calls the
boot symbols for all the other xs files in the module.  The distinction
is that the toplevel module, Gtk2, has no colons in its name.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`xsubpp\*(C'\fR generates the boot function's name by replacing the 
colons in the \s-1MODULE\s0 name with underscores and prepending \*(L"boot_\*(R".
We need to be careful not to include the boot code for the bootstrapped module,
(say Toplevel, or Gtk2, or whatever) because the bootstrap code in 
Toplevel.pm will call boot_Toplevel when loaded, and boot_Toplevel
should actually include the file we are creating here.
.Sp
The default value for the ignore parameter ignores any name not containing
colons, because it is assumed that this will be a toplevel module, and any
other packages/modules it boots will be \fIbelow\fR this namespace, i.e., they
will contain colons.  This assumption holds true for Gtk2 and Gnome2, but
obviously fails for something like Gnome2::Canvas.  To boot that module
properly, you must use a regular expression such as \*(L"^Gnome2::Canvas$\*(R".
.Sp
Note that you can, of course, match more than just one name, e.g.
\&\*(L"^(Foo|Foo::Bar)$\*(R", if you wanted to have Foo::Bar be included in the same
dynamically loaded object but only be booted when absolutely necessary.
(If you get that to work, more power to you.)
.Sp
Also, since this code scans for ^MODULE, you must comment the \s-1MODULE\s0 section
out with leading # marks if you want to hide it from \f(CW\*(C`write_boot\*(C'\fR.
.IP "Glib::CodeGen\->parse_maps (\s-1PREFIX\s0, [\s-1KEY\s0 => \s-1VAL\s0, ...])" 4
.IX Item "Glib::CodeGen->parse_maps (PREFIX, [KEY => VAL, ...])"
Convention within Glib/Gtk2 and friends is to use preprocessor macros in the
style of SvMyType and newSVMyType to get values in and out of perl, and to
use those same macros from both hand-written code as well as the typemaps.
However, if you have a lot of types in your library (such as the nearly 200
types in Gtk+ 2.x), then writing those macros becomes incredibly tedious, 
especially so when you factor in all of the variants and such.
.Sp
So, this function can turn a flat file containing terse descriptions of the
types into a header containing all the cast macros, a typemap file using them,
and an \s-1XSH\s0 file containing the proper code to register each of those types
(to be included by your module's \s-1BOOT\s0 code).
.Sp
The \fI\s-1PREFIX\s0\fR is mandatory, and is used in some of the resulting filenames,
You can also override the defaults by providing key=>val pairs:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&  input    input file name.  default is 'maps'.  if this
\&           key's value is an array reference, all the
\&           filenames in the array will be scanned.
\&  header   name of the header file to create, default is
\&           build/$prefix\-autogen.h
\&  typemap  name of the typemap file to create, default is
\&           build/$prefix.typemap
\&  register name of the xsh file to contain all of the 
\&           type registrations, default is build/register.xsh
.Ve
.Sp
the maps file is a table of type descriptions, one per line, with fields
separated by whitespace.  the fields should be:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&  TYPE macro    e.g., GTK_TYPE_WIDGET 
\&  class name    e.g. GtkWidget, name of the C type
\&  base type     one of GObject, GBoxed, GEnum, GFlags.
\&                To support other base types, see 
\&                EXTENDING TYPE SUPPORT for info on
\&                on how to add a custom type handler.
\&  package       name of the perl package to which this
\&                class name should be mapped, e.g.
\&                Gtk2::Widget
.Ve
.Sp
As a special case, you can also use this same format to register error
domains; in this case two of the four columns take on slightly different
meanings:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  domain macro     e.g., GDK_PIXBUF_ERROR
\&  enum type macro  e.g., GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF_ERROR
\&  base type        GError
\&  package          name of the Perl package to which this
\&                   class name should be mapped, e.g.,
\&                   Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf::Error.

\&\f(CW\*(C`parse_maps\*(C'\fR uses the base type entry in each maps record to decide how to
generate output for that type.  In the base module, type support is included
for the base types provided by Glib.  It is easy to add support for your own
types, by merely adding a type handler.  This type handler will call utility
functions to add typemaps, \s-1BOOT\s0 lines, and header lines.

Use \fI$handler\fR to generate output for records whose base type is
\&\fI$base_type\fR.  \fI$base_type\fR is the C type name as found in the third
column of a maps file entry.
.Sp
\&\fI$handler\fR will be called with the (possibly preprocessed) contents of the
current maps file record, and should call the \f(CW\*(C`add_typemap\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`add_register\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`add_header\*(C'\fR functions to set up the necessary C/XS glue for that type.
