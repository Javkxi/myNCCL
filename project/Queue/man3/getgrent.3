.SH NAME
getgrent, setgrent, endgrent \- get group file entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <grp.h>
.sp
.B struct group *getgrent(void);
.sp
.B void setgrent(void);
.sp
.B void endgrent(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgetgrent\fP()
function returns a pointer to a structure containing
the broken-out fields of a record in the group database
(e.g., the local group file 
.IR /etc/group ,
NIS, and LDAP).
The first time it is called
it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns successive entries.
.PP
The \fBsetgrent\fP() function rewinds to the beginning 
of the group database, to allow repeated scans.
.PP
The \fBendgrent\fP() function is used to close the group database
after all processing has been performed.
.PP
The \fIgroup\fP structure is defined in \fI<grp.h>\fP as follows:
.sp
.RS +0.25i
.nf
struct group {
    char   *gr_name;       /* group name */
    char   *gr_passwd;     /* group password */
    gid_t   gr_gid;        /* group ID */
    char  **gr_mem;        /* group members */
};
.fi
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBgetgrent\fP() function returns a pointer to a
.I group 
structure, 
or NULL if there are no more entries or an error occurs.
.LP
Upon error,
.I errno
may be set.
If one wants to check
.I errno
after the call, it should be set to zero before the call.
